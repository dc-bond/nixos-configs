This repository contains the declarative configuration for my NixOS systems.

## Highlights
- ❄️ Nix flakes handle upstream dependencies and track latest stable release of Nixpkgs
- 🏠 [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) manages dotfiles and user-specific configurations
- 🤫 [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix) manages secrets with age encryption
- ☁️ Self-hosted services including Nextcloud, Authelia, Matrix, Photoprism, and 40+ others
- 🔒  Automatic Let's Encrypt certificate registration and renewal with [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik) reverse proxy
- 🐳 Hybrid approach: native NixOS services + OCI [docker] containers for select applications where native nix modules either don't exist or are incomplete
- 🧩 Modular architecture facilitates quick deployment of services across different hosts
- 💾 Declarative disk management with BTRFS and LUKS encryption
- 🚀 Distributed builds leverage remote server for fast parallel compilation

## Architecture

This configuration spans multiple machine types:
- **Homelab servers**: Primary service hosts running self-hosted applications
- **VPS instances**: Public-facing services that work better when not behind NAT and/or require 99% uptime
- **Workstations**: Desktop and laptop configurations with GUI environments
- **Specialized hosts**: Various other systems with specific purposes

Each host is defined in `hosts/<hostname>/` and can selectively import service modules from `nixos-system/` as needed. User configurations are managed separately through home-manager, allowing different users to have distinct environments on the same machine.

## Philosophy

This configuration emphasizes reproducibility and modularity. Each service is defined as a self-contained module that can be easily enabled on any host. Secrets are managed securely with SOPS, and system state is version-controlled and declarative.
