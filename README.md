This is the root directory for my IBM thinkpad laptop's nixos-based linux operating system configuration. It contains an ansible script to setup LUKS-based drive encryption and formatting in preparation for a nix flake-based install directly from this repo. You can clone this repo and adjust the hardware-configuration.nix file for your machine's architecture before attempting to install with 'sudo nixos-install --no-root-passwd --flake .#thinkpad' but your mileage may vary.
